/*
* A 1000x1000 pixel field is displayed at TheMillionEtherHomepage.com. 
* This smart contract lets anyone buy 10x10 pixel blocks and place ads there.
* It also allows to sell blocks and rent them out to other advertisers. 
*
* 10x10 pixels blocks are addressed by xy coordinates. So 1000x1000 pixel field is 100 by 100 blocks.
* Making up 10 000 blocks in total. Each block is an ERC721 (non fungible token) token. 
*
* At the initial sale the price for each block is $1 (price is feeded by an oracle). After
* every 1000 blocks sold (every 10%) the price doubles. Owners can sell and rent out blocks at any
* price they want. Owners and renters can place and replace ads to their blocks as many times they 
* want.
*
* All heavy logic is delegated to external upgradable contracts. There are 4 main modules (contracts):
*     - MEH: Million Ether Homepage (MEH) contract. Provides user interface and accounting 
*         functionality. It is immutable and it keeps Non fungible ERC721 tokens (10x10 pixel blocks) 
*         ledger and eth balances. 
*     - Market: Plugable. Provides methods for buy-sell functionality, keeps buy-sell ledger, 
*         querries oracle for a ETH-USD price, 
*     - Rentals: Plugable. Provides methods for rentout-rent functionality, keeps rentout-rent ledger.
*     - Ads: Plugable. Provides methods for image placement functionality.
